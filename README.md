Project Description

This project involves extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on global COVID-19 datasets using SQL Server. 
By leveraging SQL's analytical capabilities, I investigated infection trends, death rates, and vaccination rollouts across countries and continents. 
This project helped derive meaningful insights from large datasets to support data-driven decision-making and reporting.
